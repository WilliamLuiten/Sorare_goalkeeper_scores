# Sorare Goalkeeper Scoring Analysis: Impact of the 2025 Matrix Update

This repository contains the data analysis behind the Medium post:  
**"How Sorareâ€™s New Scoring Matrix Changes the Game for Goalkeepers"**

## Context

In 2025, Sorare updated their scoring system by **removing the negative decisive for goalkeepers** who concede three or more goals. This change particularly affects GKs from lower-tier teams, who face more shots but now arenâ€™t punished as severely. Goalkeepers from lower-tier teams are typically more affordable in the Sorare market. This analysis explores whether that price gap is still justified under the updated scoring matrix.

## Goal

Analyze how the rule change impacts:
- Goalkeeper performance by **team quality** (based on ELO quintiles)
- **Home vs. away** performances
- Matchup effects across opponent strength
- Strategic implications for Sorare managers

## Summary of Key Findings

- **Goalkeepers from bottom-tier teams improved the most**, now scoring on par with mid-table goalkeepers.
- **Elite goalkeepers still top the charts**, largely due to more clean sheets.
- **Home advantage** narrows the gap between elite and budget goalkeepers.
- **Matchups still matter**, but the penalty for facing stronger teams is smaller.
